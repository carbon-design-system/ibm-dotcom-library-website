## Introduction
The Carbon for IBM.com team is working to adopt the Carbon design system for IBM.com. Please check the [adoption paths](http://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/get-started#how-to-decide-the-right-path-for-adoption) and discuss with your team before adopting Carbon for IBM.com.  

The Carbon for IBM.com and Carbon Expressive kits includes expressive type styles for editorial experiences and IBM.com specific components including the IBM.com masthead and footer. Teams should utilize the Carbon Expressive design kits for core components such as buttons, form components, etc. If you have any questions please reach out on our [slack channel](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).

The Expressive Theme has been integrated into Carbon Design System's core library. It simply means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences from the same [design kit source](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/sketch/).

## Get the kit

To design with the Carbon for IBM.com you must have the most recent version of [Sketch](hhttps://w3.ibm.com/design/toolbox/#/ui-design-tools/README?id=sketch) installed.
You can download the [Carbon Design Kits](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/sketch/) on the Carbon website.

## Expressive text styles
Text styles are based on the typography rules that are defined by the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).

## Accessibility
Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone. Please view the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview" target="_blank">Accessibility guideline</a> on the Carbon website to learn more about the accessibility best practices.

## Info
If you’re brand new to Sketch, they offer some great [tutorials and help docs](https://www.sketch.com/docs/).

### Updates
We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window.

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.

### Support
If you experience any issues while getting set up with Carbon for IBM.com, please head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-design-kit) and please [create an issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom-design-kit/issues/new?assignees=oliviaflory&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BDesign+kit%5D%3A+Brief+description) if your issue does not already exist.
